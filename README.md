# Classification of Life Insurance Policy Claims Risk Using Various Boosting Techniques
I completed this projects as a part of my undergraduate thesis, covering interdiciplinary topics of machine learning and actuarial science. Working as an intern in two Insurance companies showed me the potential of implementing automation in regular insurers' workflow. One use case that took my interest was policy risk classification using boosting methods.

There are two files that will guide you through my work. The first one is a summary covering background, based theory, methodology, and the result of my study and the later file is the coding draft of my project.
