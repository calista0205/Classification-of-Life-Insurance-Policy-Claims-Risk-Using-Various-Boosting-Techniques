# Classification of Life Insurance Policy Claims Risk Using Various Boosting Techniques
Indonesia has hundred of insurers in general and life fields, however insurance literacy in remote areas is highly limited. Guiding the community to understand the benefits of insurance may start by creating an accurate risk segmentation tool. Since most underwriting process are done manually and some prospective customers can be difficult to analyse, the process will become costly and time consuming. By classifying prospective customers into different classes, insurers can recommend the right products for them, creating an optimal risk mitigation scheme.

But why boosting? Among other machine learning techniques, boosting is popular for its effectiveness, speed, accuracy, and adjustable parameters. The variation of boosting methods caught my attention and brought question about which one suited best for my data. I use Prudential Life Insurance Assessment 2015 dataset, containing 127 variables relating to customers' risk profile. 

There are two main files that I uploaded here. The first one is the summary of my research covering backgorund, theory, methodology, and results. The second file contain my Python coding for this research.
